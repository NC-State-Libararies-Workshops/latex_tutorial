Installing LaTeX on your own computer depends on your operating system. So there are 
different installations for Mac, Windows and Linux. There are also online LaTeX editors 
which we'll introduce here.  Here are [instructions](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) 
for installing LaTeX on your computer and some links to online editors. For this tutorial 
we'll be using the online editor **OverLeaf**. They should all work about the same, but 
there may be subtle differences here and there.
